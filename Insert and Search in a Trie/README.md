Insert and Search in a Trie

Complete the Insert and Search functions for a Trie Data Structure. 

Insert: Accepts the Trie's root and a string, modifies the root in-place, and returns nothing.
Search: Takes the Trie's root and a string, returns true if the string is in the Trie, otherwise false.
Note: To test the correctness of your code, the code-judge will be inserting a list of N strings called into the Trie, and then will search for the string key in the Trie. The code-judge will generate 1 if the key is present in the Trie, else 0.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 8
list[] = {the, a, there, answer, any, by, bye, their}
key = the

Output: 

Explanation: 
"the" is present in the given set of strings. 


Example 2:

Input:
n = 8
list[] = {the, a, there, answer, any, by, bye, their}
key = geeks

Output: 0

Explanation: 
"geeks" is not present in the
given set of strings.


Your Task:
You do not have to take any input or print anything. Complete insert and search functions. 

Expected Time Complexity: O(M+|key|)

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(M)

Here M = sum of the length of all strings which are present in the list[] 

Constraints:

1 <= N <= 104
1 <= length of list[i] <= 30
All strings will constitute of lowercase alphabets only.
