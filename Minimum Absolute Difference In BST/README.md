Given a binary search tree having n (n>1) nodes, the task is to find the minimum absolute difference between any two nodes.


Your Task:
You don't have to take any input. Just complete the function absolute_diff() , that takes root as input and return minimum absolute difference between any two nodes.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(Height of tree)

Constraints:
2 <= n <= 105
1 <= Node->data <= 109
